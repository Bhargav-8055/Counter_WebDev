# Counter_WebDev
I have Made a Counter (A tiny Project) when I was Learning Javascript. This is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript
In the application I made, it consists of
1. Display of the Number
2. Decrease Button ---> To Decrease the current displaying number by 1 and display it
3. Reset Button ----> To Reset the number to 0 and display it
4. Increase Button ---> To Increase the current displaying number by 1 and display it

Things Learnt:
1. I understood the importance of Javascript which gives the response when a button is pressed.
2. Applying the logic when the particular button is pressed
3. Writing a proper structured code
